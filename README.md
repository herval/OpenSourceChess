# Open Source Chess

[Download the game on Itch.io](https://herval.itch.io/open-source-chess)!

A very basic game of Chess, written in Unity2D.

The current version of the game is pretty bare-bones, but already covers some basics:

- Spritesheet-based assets
- A board with customizable size, for "custom" chess variants (default is 8x8)
- Movement rules for all the pieces, including capturing opponent pieces
- Single player/local multiplayer

## Roadmap/to do

- Finish the check/check-mate rules and end-of-game
- Introduce some basic AI for single player games
- Better visuals! Animations! Sounds!
